            Welcome to the help page for <span class="join-text">Join</span>,
            your guide to using our kanban project management tool. Here, we'll
            provide an overview of what <span class="join-text">Join</span> is,

          <h2>What is Join?</h2>
          <p>
            <span class="join-text">Join</span> is a kanban-based project
            management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students
            as part of their web development bootcamp at the
            <span class="join-text">Developer Akademie</span>. Kanban, a
            Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to
            visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or
            flow). <span class="join-text">Join</span> leverages the principles
            of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an
            intuitive, visual interface. It is important to note that
            <span class="join-text">Join</span> is designed as an educational
            exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we
            strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot
            guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other

          <h2>How to use it</h2>
          <p>
            Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use
            <span class="join-text">Join</span>:
          </p>
          <ol class="howToUseList">
            <li>
              <h3>Exploring the board</h3>
              <p>
                When you log in to <span class="join-text">Join</span>, you'll
                find a default board. This board represents your project and
                contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await
                feedback” and "Done".
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
              <p>
                In <span>Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on
                your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New
                contact", and fill in the required information. Once added,
                these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with
                the tasks on the board.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
              <p>
                Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
                Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
                appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details
                in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees,
                etc.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
              <p>
                As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect
                that on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one
                list to another.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
              <p>
                Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done"
                list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it
                from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as
                this action is irreversible. Remember that using Join
                effectively requires consistent updates from you and your team
                to ensure the board reflects the current state of your project.
